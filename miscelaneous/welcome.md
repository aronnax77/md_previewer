Markdown is a simple text format which allows the writer to prepare a document which can be converted into other formats such as HTML.  In comparison to writing a document in HTML the format is relatively simple and straightforward and also provides the benefit that it can be easily read before conversion.  This form of documentation is used by sites like git hub where the Readme.md is prepared in markdown.  For more information on markdown see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Illustration
------------

As a quick illustration unordered lists can be written as follows:

- this is an unordeered list
- ordered lists are just as easy
	1. This is an indented ordered list
	2. and so on.
	
Code snippets, blockquotes and images are also easily include.  For example a code snippet takes the form:

``` python

a = 10
print(a)

```

A block quote attributed to Albert Einstein:

> I am by heritage a Jew, by citizenship a Swiss, and by makeup a human being, and only a human being, without any special attachment to any state or national entity whatsoever.

And finally an image.
