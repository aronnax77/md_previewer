Build a Markdown Previewer

    Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

    Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

    User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

    User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

    Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

    Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor

    Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

    When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. 

	You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.



Suplementary - use jsPDF to export as pdf.
